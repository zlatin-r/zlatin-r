### I'm Zlatin! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm on an exciting journey in the world of programming at SoftUni in Bulgaria. Coming from a background in Bulgaria, I've delved deeply into a variety of courses that have built a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving. So far, Iâ€™ve successfully completed courses in Programming Basics with Python, Programming Fundamentals, Python Advanced, Python OOP, and even explored the powerful Django ORM, PostgreSQL databases, and the essential HTML & CSS for front-end development.
