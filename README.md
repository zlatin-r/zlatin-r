### Hi there I'm Zlatin! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Hello, my name is Zlatin Rusev, and I'm on an exciting journey in the world of programming at SoftUni in Bulgaria. Coming from a background in Bulgaria, I've delved deeply into a variety of courses that have built a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving. So far, Iâ€™ve successfully completed courses in Programming Basics with Python, Programming Fundamentals, Python Advanced, Python OOP, and even explored the powerful Django ORM, PostgreSQL databases, and the essential HTML & CSS for front-end development.

These courses have given me a solid technical foundation, but beyond that, they've sparked a passion for building, learning, and creating solutions that are both practical and innovative. Iâ€™m motivated to keep expanding my skills and knowledge, exploring new technologies, and finding ways to apply my learning in impactful projects. The journey so far has been challenging but incredibly rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to see where it will lead!
